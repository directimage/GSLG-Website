		<p>Project Summary &nbsp;<span></span></p>
		<p>GS Lighting Group worked together with Rombald Engineering to identify the most functional lighting system with a low operating energy cost. The lighting system is the product of clean, functional lighting to meet the LEED certified equivalent and ASHRAE 90.1 requirements through the use of low profile LED fixtures.</p><p>The facilities at Mammoet needed to be designed and operated as a building that meets LEED certification. In order to adhere to the client's requirements, the maintenance shop area utilized high performance LED linear high bay light fixtures from Columbia Lighting, the LLHP model, complete with multiple local zones. This high performance light fixture enabled greater spacing between the light fixtures, while still maintaining required light levels needed in a maintenance shop and still reducing energy consumption and cost. The other area that required further consideration was the two floor-level office areas with a sunroom terrace. Within the enclosed and open offices, a Stail RMEP6 LED low profile light fixture from Metalumen was selected to obtain a 40 foot candle average level at 2.5 feet above the finished floor with an average of 30 foot candles on the vertical work surfaces. This fixture needed to have a direct and indirect component to enhance the office feel, with minimum glare component through the use of micro prismatic lens down optic. The attractive aspect of the space wouldn't be complete without the use of LED downlighting for illuminating and accenting hallways and open office perimeters by utilizing Eureka and Prescolite LED light fixtures. The state of the art second-floor main boardroom showcases decorative LED Bass square downlights from Eureka and LED suspended Lumination EP14 from GE, all easily controlled from local occupancy sensors and LED dimmers.</p><p>Outdoor LED lighting was utilized to provide parking lot and yard illumination to meet city standards with outstanding uniformity. General illumination and vertical glazing around the exterior of the maintenance shop area was accomplished through LED wall packs and LED downlights. The LED fixtures have an expected life span of 50,000 hours, allowing for Mammoet to benefit from the reduced maintenance costs of these light fixtures with the exception of an occasional dusting. The project utilized LED fixtures for multiple indoor and outdoor applications, which has led to an increase in energy efficiency and improved the overall design of the building.
